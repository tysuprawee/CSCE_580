Ingredients
For the streusel:
125 g cold butter
110 g caster sugar
125 g all-purpose flour

For the batter:
110 g softened butter
110 g caster sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
150 g ricotta
250 g all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
Zest of 1 lemon
1 level teaspoon salt
500 g blueberries
Powdered sugar for dusting

Step 1: Prep
Preheat the oven to 180 °C (350°F). Line the bottom of a springform pan with parchment and grease the sides.

Step 2: Blueberries
Wash the blueberries in a sieve. Let them drip, then dry them on a clean kitchen towel.

Step 3: Make the Streusel
Add flour, the cold cubed butter, and the sugar into the mixing bowl. Using a paddle attachment, mix at low speed until crumbles are formed. Do not overmix. Transfer to another bowl and refrigerate while preparing the batter.

Step 4: Cream Butter and Sugar
Add the softened butter into the mixing bowl and beat until light and fluffy. Add the sugar bit by bit and mix until well combined.

Step 5: Add Wet Ingredients
Lightly beat the eggs before slowly adding them to the creamed butter and sugar mixture while stirring constantly. Mix in vanilla, then the ricotta until combined. Add lemon zest if using freshly grated zest. If the mixture separates when pouring in the egg, add a spoonful of flour to fix it.

Step 6: Add Dry Ingredients
In a separate bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, lemon zest, and salt. Gradually add to the batter on low speed until just combined.

Step 7: Assemble the Cake
Spoon the batter into the tin and spread with a spatula. Place the blueberries on top. Sprinkle the chilled streusel evenly over the fruit.

Step 8: Bake
Bake in the bottom third of the preheated oven for about 60-70 minutes or until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.

Step 9: Enjoy
Let the cake cool in the tin for about 20 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Dust with powdered sugar and serve plain or with vanilla ice cream.
